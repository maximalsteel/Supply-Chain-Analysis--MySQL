# Supply-Chain-Case-Study-SQL

# Introduction

In this case study, we explored the management and analysis of a comprehensive supply chain database for "Richard's Supply," a company specializing in various food products. Over a period of 2 years, the database includes critical tables such as Customers, Orders, Order Items, Products, and Suppliers. Our primary objective was to derive insights and address specific business questions related to supply chain operations.

## What We Have Done

### Order Analysis:

- Calculated the total amount saved in each order by comparing actual product prices with selling prices.
- Identified products ordered in quantities of one.
- Found customers who ordered more than 10 products in a single order.
- Determined the latest order date for customers (excluding the first order date) and listed their details.

### Product Dependencies:

- Identified products that the UK depends on other countries for supply and listed the supplying countries.

### Customer and Supplier Relationships:

- Created a combined list of customers and suppliers based on specific criteria, such as same country residence, customers without suppliers in their country, and suppliers without customers in their country.
- Listed customers belonging to the same city and country.

### Revenue Analysis:

- Identified the top 3 suppliers based on revenue generated by their products.
- Displayed the product and supplier names for each order.

### Order Dates:

- Listed current and previous order dates for each customer.

This case study provides a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the supply chain, facilitating improved decision-making and operational efficiency.
