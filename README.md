# Supply Chain Analysis - MySQL

## Introduction
In this case study, we explored the management and analysis of a comprehensive supply chain database for **"Richard's Supply,"** a company specializing in various food products. The database, spanning 2 years, includes critical tables such as **Customers**, **Orders**, **Order Items**, **Products**, and **Suppliers**. Our primary objective was to derive insights and address specific business questions related to supply chain operations.

## What We Have Done

### 1. Order Analysis:
- Calculated the total amount saved in each order by comparing actual product prices with selling prices.
- Identified products ordered in quantities of one.
- Found customers who ordered more than 10 products in a single order.
- Determined the latest order date for customers (excluding the first order date) and listed their details.

### 2. Product Dependencies:
- Identified products that the UK depends on other countries for supply and listed the supplying countries.

### 3. Customer and Supplier Relationships:
- Created a combined list of customers and suppliers based on specific criteria, such as same country residence, customers without suppliers in their country, and suppliers without customers in their country.
- Listed customers belonging to the same city and country.

### 4. Revenue Analysis:
- Identified the top 3 suppliers based on revenue generated by their products.
- Displayed the product and supplier names for each order.

### 5. Order Dates:
- Listed current and previous order dates for each customer.

This case study provides a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the supply chain, facilitating improved decision-making and operational efficiency.
